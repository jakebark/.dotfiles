## general principles

- Make code accessible. Code should be easy to understand and behaviour should be localised. I shouldnt have to traverse three files to understand one function. I would rather have flat accessible code than DRY code. 
- Do one thing really well. Products, functions, and resources should do one thing reakly well. No feature bloat. Keep things lean. We dont add features to be busy.

## naming principles

- Consistent. Names should be predictable across environments, accounts, and classes.
